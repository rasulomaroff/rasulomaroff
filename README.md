### Hi!

##### If you happen to use Neovim, take a look at my plugins :)

-  [telepath.nvim](https://github.com/rasulomaroff/telepath.nvim) - motion plugin that allows to operate on text-objects remotely
-  [reactive.nvim](https://github.com/rasulomaroff/reactive.nvim) - this plugin allows you to apply highlights dynamically based on different modes, operators, and window states
-  [cmp-bufname](https://github.com/rasulomaroff/cmp-bufname) - a source of opened buffers (files) names for completion 
-  [cursor.nvim](https://github.com/rasulomaroff/cursor.nvim) - a simple utility that provides the easier way of configuring cursors

#### Also, check out npm libraries for React:

- [react-rv](https://github.com/rasulomaroff/react-rv) - lightweight library for using reactive variables
- [@evit](https://github.com/rasulomaroff/evit) - evit = event it, stateless events for react with hooks
